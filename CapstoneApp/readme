🎓 Senior Capstone Website – Facial Recognition Attendance System
This repository contains the full implementation and documentation for our Senior Capstone Project — a facial recognition-based attendance tracking system with a web-based interface and database integration.

🫠 Overview
The Smart Attendance System leverages facial recognition technology to automate student attendance tracking. Key features include:

📸 Classroom Photo Processing: Process class photos for attendance tracking.

🧠 AI-Powered Face Detection & Identification: Uses YOLOv8 for face detection and DeepFace for student identification.

🗂️ Daily Attendance Records: Automatically tracks attendance and updates records.

✏️ Manual Correction Interface: Easily adjust attendance data when needed.

📊 Excel Report Generation: Export attendance data for analysis and reporting.

Potential Use Cases:

🎓 University/College Attendance Systems

💼 Corporate Training Sessions

🎟️ Event Check-in Systems

🚀 Getting Started
🛠 Prerequisites:
Python 3.9+

Webcam (for real-time capture option)

Modern web browser

🔧 Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-attendance-system.git
cd smart-attendance-system

2. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the face detection model:
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n-face.pt


🧪 Database Setup:
Add student face images to the database/ folder using the naming format: Firstname_Lastname.jpg.

Update students.xlsx to match student names with image filenames.

⚡ Run the Application:
python app.py

📷 How to Use
1 Access the Web Interface:

Visit the web app at http://localhost:5000.

2 Upload a Class Photo:

Upload a class photo containing students' faces.

3 System Process:

The system will automatically detect faces in the image.

It will match the faces against the known student database.

The attendance records will be updated based on the identified students.

You can manually adjust any incorrect identifications.

4 Export Attendance Report:

Generate and export attendance records as Excel files when needed.

📁 Output Files
File Type	Location	Description
Master Attendance	attendancesheet.xlsx	Complete attendance history.
Export Reports	attendance_export_*.xlsx	Dated attendance snapshots.
Processed Images	static/attendance/attendance_*.jpg	Annotated images with detected faces.

✍️ Future Work
Real-time camera feed processing.

Student attendance history dashboard.

Multi-class support.

Enhanced admin interface for easier management.

Mobile responsiveness improvements.
